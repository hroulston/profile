Hi! I am an entrepreneur turned software developer.

I spent many years understanding customers needs and wants and transforming what I learned into sales and growth for my business. I am a software driven developer that is passionate about creating intuitive code that is beneficial for users and fellow developers alike. My experience includes working with different languages and frameworks utilizing a test driven development frame of mind.

I strive to always create a positive impact in any way possible and love working on collaborative teams. I am an innovative thinker and goal setter that has no problem transferring dreams into reachable goals that create a reality.
